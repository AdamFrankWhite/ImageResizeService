DONE - List allowed extensions. Only allow safe and critical extensions for business functionality
Ensure that input validation is applied before validating the extensions.
DONE - Validate the file type, don't trust the Content-Type header as it can be spoofed
DONE - Change the filename to something generated by the application
Set a filename length limit. Restrict the allowed characters if possible
Set a file size limit
DONE - Only allow authorized users to upload files

In the case of public access to the files, use a handler that gets mapped to filenames inside the application (someid -> file.ext)
Run the file through an antivirus or a sandbox if available to validate that it doesn't contain malicious data
Ensure that any libraries used are securely configured and kept up to date
Protect the file upload from CSRF attacks
